## Introduction

NMEA 2000 is a networking standard for marine electronics, used by most modern marine electronics hardware.
It is is constructed from a a number of devices connected to a single bus, called the network backbone.
All devices on the network can both transmit and receive messages.

An illustration of a typical NMEA 2000 network with some example devices is shown below.

The network backbone is shown in pale blue color.
All devices connect to the backbone using drop cables.
Only one device can be connected to a single drop cable.

At the very minimum, the network must have a 5-way T-connector, two terminators, a power connection, and two devices with their own drop cables.
